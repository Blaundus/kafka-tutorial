[#producer]
== What are Producers?

Producers publish messages to a topic at the end of a partition.
By default, if a message contains a key, the hashed value of the key is used to decide in which partition the message is stored.
If the key is `null`, then a round-robin algorithm is used to balance the messages across all partitions.

Kafka guarantees that all as long as no new partitions are added, elements with the same key will be stored in the same partition.

If you want you can also implement a custom partitioning strategy to store messages in a specific partition following any kind of business rule.

[#consumer]
== What are Consumers?

Each message published to a topic is delivered to a consumer that is subscribed to that topic.

A consumer can read data from any position of the partition, and internally it is stored as a pointer called `offset`.
In most of the cases, a consumer advances its `offset` linearly, but it could be in any order, or starting from any given position.

Each consumer belongs to a consumer group.
A consumer group is a list of consumer instances that ensures the scalability for processing messages and also fault tolerance.

When a consumer group only contains one consumer, this consumer is responsible for processing all messages of all partitions.

The more consumers you add to a group, each consumer will only receive messages from a subset of the partitions.

IMPORTANT: If you add more consumers in a consumer group than the number of partitions for a topic, then they will stay in an idle state, without getting any message.

As you can see what is registered to a topic is the _consumer group_ and not the consumer.
The consumer is "subscribed" to a partition.
