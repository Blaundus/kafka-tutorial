[#topic-creation]
== Create a Topic

Apache Kafka auto-creates topics when a message is published to the topic.

You can also use `kafka-topic.sh` tool to create a topic manually.

include::partial$docker-exec.adoc[]

Inside the container, create a topic with name `songs` with a single partition and only one replica:

[.console-input]
[source, bash-shell]
----
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:29092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic songs
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:29092
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
songs
----

Now that the topic is created and you've validated that the topic has been created, you can run the `exit` command:

[.console-input]
[source, bash-shell]
----
exit
----

[#topic-info]
== Get Topic information

You can get topic information by using `kafkacat`:

[.console-input]
[source, bash-shell]
----
kafkacat -b localhost:9092 -L
----

[.console-output]
[source, bash-shell]
----
